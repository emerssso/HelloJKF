# HelloJKF
This project was my attempt at linking together a couple of build tools in a simple Hello World proof-of-concept.

It combines a [Jenkins Pipeline](https://jenkins.io/doc/book/pipeline/) job running with the [Kubernetes plugin](https://github.com/jenkinsci/kubernetes-plugin)
with Firebase Test Lab to run instrumentation tests.

I gave a quick talk on the process of getting this set up that I'm currently converting to a more detailed walkthrough of the steps.
